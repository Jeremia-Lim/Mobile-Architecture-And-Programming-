Application Summary and Goals 
The goal of this project was to design and develop a fully functional Android mobile application that demonstrates user-centered design principles and mobile development best practices. The application was
designed to address the need for a secure and organized inventory management system. Rather than simply storing data, the app provides a structured environment where users can log in, manage inventory items,
track quantities, and receive notifications for important updates such as low stock alerts. The primary user need addressed by this application was the ability to efficiently monitor and manage inventory 
within a secure and accessible mobile interface.

Screens, Features, and User-Centered Design 
To support user needs, the application included multiple essential screens and features. These included a login screen for authentication, an inventory dashboard displaying items in an organized layout, forms for
adding and editing inventory entries, and SMS notification functionality for low inventory alerts. The user interface was intentionally designed to be simple, intuitive, and predictable. Clear labeling, consistent
navigation patterns, appropriately sized buttons, and logical screen transitions were implemented to reduce cognitive load. Accessibility considerations were incorporated to ensure input fields and controls were easy
to interact with on mobile devices. These design choices were successful because they prioritized clarity, minimized user errors, and supported efficient task completion.

Development Approach and Techniques 
The coding process followed a structured and incremental development strategy. Rather than building all components at once, features were implemented step by step and tested frequently. SQLite was used to
ensure secure and persistent data storage across sessions. Code organization was prioritized by separating user interface logic, database operations, and application functionality. Permissions such as SMS access were
handled carefully to ensure secure execution under different conditions. These strategies can be applied in future projects to maintain clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

Testing and Debugging Process 
Testing was conducted continuously throughout development using the Android Emulator and the Android Studio debugger. Breakpoints were set to monitor variable values and ensure database and permission
handling behaved correctly. Edge cases, such as invalid input or denied permissions, were intentionally tested to ensure the application responded appropriately. This testing process was critical because it
revealed potential issues early, reduced large-scale debugging later, and ensured the final application functioned reliably. Continuous testing reinforces stability and improves overall product quality.

Innovation and Problem Solving 
Throughout the development process, innovation was necessary when handling permission management and secure data persistence. Ensuring SMS notifications worked correctly under different permission states
required troubleshooting and adjustment. Additionally, designing a clean and scalable inventory layout required refining UI components to balance functionality and simplicity. Overcoming these challenges
strengthened both my technical skills and problem-solving ability.

Demonstration of Knowledge and Skills 
The component in which I most successfully demonstrated my knowledge and skills was the integration of secure data persistence with SQLite combined with real-time SMS notification functionality. This feature
required understanding database management, Android permissions, and responsive UI updates. Successfully implementing these elements showcased my ability to build a practical, secure, and user-
focused mobile application.

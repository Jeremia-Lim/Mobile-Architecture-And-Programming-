	For this project, I have chosen to work on the Inventory App. The primary goal of this application is to help users efficiently track, 
   manage, and update inventory items within a warehouse environment. By providing clear visibility into item quantities and alerts for 
   depleted stock, the app supports accuracy, organization, and timely decision-making for inventory management. 
 	
The overarching purpose of the app is to allow users to view and maintain inventory data in real time. To support this goal, the application 
   would require several major components. These include a secure login screen that allows both new account creation and returning user 
   authentication, as well as a database with at least two tables: one for storing inventory items and one for user login credentials. 
   The main inventory screen would display all items in a grid format, showing key details such as item name and quantity. The app would 
   also include mechanisms to add and remove inventory items, increase or decrease item quantities, and notify users when an item’s quantity 
   reaches zero. 
 	
At a high level, the app would be designed with usability and efficiency in mind. Users would log in and immediately be presented with a clear, 
organized inventory grid. Simple controls such as buttons or input fields would allow users to quickly update item counts or add new items 
without navigating through multiple screens. Notifications would play an important role by alerting users when inventory levels are depleted, 
helping prevent stock shortages. This design ensures that the app supports users in meeting the goal of accurate and timely inventory tracking. 
 	
When compared to other inventory management apps, this application would share similarities with tools such as Sortly and Stock and Inventory. 
Like these apps, the Inventory App focuses on item tracking, quantity management, and ease of use. However, this app would be more streamlined 
and tailored to essential warehouse needs rather than advanced analytics, making it easier to users who require straightforward inventory 
control without unnecessary complexity. 
 	
The potential users of this application include three main user types. Warehouse employees may use the app daily to update item quantities as 
stock is received or shipped. Warehouse managers may use it to monitor overall inventory levels and respond to low-stock alerts. Small business 
owners may use the app periodically to maintain accurate inventory records without investing in complex enterprise systems. Users would engage 
with the app regularly, often for shorter periods, as part of their daily workflow. Overall, the app fits naturally into operational routines 
by providing quick access to critical inventory information.
